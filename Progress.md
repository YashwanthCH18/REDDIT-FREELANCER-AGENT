# Day 1 Report (16/04/2025)

### ✅ Progress
Got the Reddit API and started experimenting with it:

1. ✅ Posting is working  
2. ✅ Reading comments is working  
3. ✅ Replying to comments is working  
4. ✅ Private messaging (PM) is working  

###  Annoying Things

1. **PM requires a username**, but nobody really uses PMs on Reddit anymore — everyone just chats.  
2. **Reading comments needs the post URL**, which isn’t always super convenient.  
3. **No official support for Reddit chat**.  
   - Might need to MacGyver it with scraping or automation.  
   - OR, be upfront that it's a bot and stick with PMs — who knows, maybe users will be impressed?

# Day 2 Report (17/04/2025)

### 🧠 Thought Process
- Spent the day **thinking deeply** and finally figured out **what to build**.  
- Tomorrow's mission: **how** to build it — and maybe even kick off development if the stars align 🌟.

---

### 🚀 Project Planning
Outlined **3 rollout phases**, which will be followed **strictly one after the other**.  
👉 The next phase will begin **only if the previous one succeeds** — no exceptions.

> 📄 Details about each phase will be documented in the `plan.md` file in the GitHub repo.

---

### 🛠️ Found an OP Dev Tool
Discovered an **AI IDE** that’s:
- 💯 **100% free**
- 🆓 **Unlimited usage**
- 💪 Comes with **top-tier models**:
  - GPT-4.1
  - Claude 3.7 & 3.5
  - Gemini 2.5 Coder
  - DeepSeek
  
This tool is going to **speed things up massively** — as long as you’re crystal clear on **what** you want to do and **how** you want to do it.

---

### 🧑‍💻 Potential Team Expansion
Found **2 more potential devs** who can work on **client projects**:
1. Friend of a friend (from RV)
2. UG friend

They’ll:
- Get the job 💼  
- Do the job 👨‍💻  
- Get paid 💸  

> They won’t know where the client is from, how much the client pays, or that I’m even earning.  
> Simple deal: **50/50 split**. Clean and efficient. 🧊

# Day 3 Report (18/04/2025)

### 🔄 More Refining
1. Instead of diving straight into the “how,” I ended up **refining the “what” even more** — clarity is king.  
2. Then shifted focus to figuring out **how to build a frontend** that's not just “good,” but **great**, functional, and even includes **WebGL** support.  

---

### 🧰 Tool Time
3. Explored more **no-code and AI tools** to boost dev speed.  
4. Learned **how expert devs** build professional frontends.  
5. Checked out the **tools they use**, then...  
6. Learned about **AI tools that could replace those tools** (because why not let the robots do the heavy lifting?).  
7. Searched for **alternatives to paid or platform-locked tools** — no-code is cool till it’s clingy.  
8. **Accidentally spent more time learning frontend than working on the actual SaaS project** — oops, but hey, at least now the frontend’s gonna look fire.  

---

### 🌐 WebGL Goodness
9. Found an **awesome WebGL site**:
   - Super slick and easy to use.  
   - Supports wireframes, images, audio, video, and more!  
   - **Not fully free**, and sadly... **I’m waitlisted** when trying to register. But still, a gem.

---

### ⚙️ Getting Into the “How”
10. Kicked off work on the **"how" phase**, and from now on, I’ll be **pasting notes directly from my planning doc** (lightly cleaned up).

---

### 🧱 Action Plan
#### Phase Execution Strategy:
- **Break each phase** into smaller, executable coding tasks.
- Since AI is doing the heavy lifting:
  - Ask the AI to further divide each part.
  - Build each part.
  - **Test each feature rigorously** (not just the new one but the whole system).
  - Only proceed if everything works.

#### Internal Tools & Systems:
1. **Slack Form** to collect worker details from the start.  
2. **Context awareness** for people, clients, and jobs — especially when the same person is involved across multiple projects.  
3. Use an **AI character** (instead of training something like Gemini) — ideally one that allows uploading or injecting specific context/data.

> Note: That last point kinda sucks... might scrap it or rethink it later.

# Day 4 Report (19/04/2025)

### 🚫 No Progress Today

Couldn’t get anything done — was down with **migraines** and **food poisoning** 🤕.  
Body said **“no code today”**, and I had to listen.

Gonna rest up and bounce back stronger.  
Health > Hustle.

# Day 5 Report (20/04/2025)

### 😷 Still Recovering
Wasn’t feeling fully healthy today — still dealing with the aftermath of yesterday’s chaos (thanks, migraines + food poisoning 💀).

---

### ⚙️ Still, Got Some Work Done
- Pushed a bit through the fog and worked more on the **“how” plan**.
- The **“how” is almost done** — just needs a few final touches and it’ll be ready to execute.

> Not a full-throttle day, but progress is progress.
