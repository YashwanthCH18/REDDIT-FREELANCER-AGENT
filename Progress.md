# Day 1 Report (16/04/2025)

### ✅ Progress
Got the Reddit API and started experimenting with it:

1. ✅ Posting is working  
2. ✅ Reading comments is working  
3. ✅ Replying to comments is working  
4. ✅ Private messaging (PM) is working  

###  Annoying Things

1. **PM requires a username**, but nobody really uses PMs on Reddit anymore — everyone just chats.  
2. **Reading comments needs the post URL**, which isn’t always super convenient.  
3. **No official support for Reddit chat**.  
   - Might need to MacGyver it with scraping or automation.  
   - OR, be upfront that it's a bot and stick with PMs — who knows, maybe users will be impressed?
