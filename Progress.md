# Day 1 Report (16/04/2025)

### ✅ Progress
Got the Reddit API and started experimenting with it:

1. ✅ Posting is working  
2. ✅ Reading comments is working  
3. ✅ Replying to comments is working  
4. ✅ Private messaging (PM) is working  

###  Annoying Things

1. **PM requires a username**, but nobody really uses PMs on Reddit anymore — everyone just chats.  
2. **Reading comments needs the post URL**, which isn’t always super convenient.  
3. **No official support for Reddit chat**.  
   - Might need to MacGyver it with scraping or automation.  
   - OR, be upfront that it's a bot and stick with PMs — who knows, maybe users will be impressed?

# Day 2 Report (17/04/2025)

### 🧠 Thought Process
- Spent the day **thinking deeply** and finally figured out **what to build**.  
- Tomorrow's mission: **how** to build it — and maybe even kick off development if the stars align 🌟.

---

### 🚀 Project Planning
Outlined **3 rollout phases**, which will be followed **strictly one after the other**.  
👉 The next phase will begin **only if the previous one succeeds** — no exceptions.

> 📄 Details about each phase will be documented in the `plan.md` file in the GitHub repo.

### 🛠️ Found an OP Dev Tool
Discovered an **AI IDE** that’s:
- 💯 **100% free**
- 🆓 **Unlimited usage**
- 💪 Comes with **top-tier models**:
  - GPT-4.1
  - Claude 3.7 & 3.5
  - Gemini 2.5 Coder
  - DeepSeek
  
This tool is going to **speed things up massively** — as long as you’re crystal clear on **what** you want to do and **how** you want to do it.

---

### 🧑‍💻 Potential Team Expansion
Found **2 more potential devs** who can work on **client projects**:
1. Friend of a friend (from RV)
2. UG friend

They’ll:
- Get the job 💼  
- Do the job 👨‍💻  
- Get paid 💸  

> They won’t know where the client is from, how much the client pays, or that I’m even earning.  
> Simple deal: **50/50 split**. Clean and efficient. 🧊
